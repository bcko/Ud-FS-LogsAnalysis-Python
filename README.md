# Logs-Analysis

## Scenario
You've been hired onto a team working on a newspaper site. The user-facing newspaper site frontend itself, and the database behind it, are already built and running. You've been asked to build an internal reporting tool that will use information from the database to discover what kind of articles the site's readers like.

The database contains newspaper articles, as well as the web server log for the site. The log has a database row for each time a reader loaded a web page. Using that information, your code will answer questions about the site's user activity.

The program you write in this project will run from the command line. It won't take any input from the user. Instead, it will connect to that database, use SQL queries to analyze the log data, and print out the answers to some questions.

## Why this project?
In this project, you will stretch your SQL database skills. You will get practice interacting with a live database both from the command line and from your code. You will explore a large database with over a million rows. And you will build and refine complex queries and use them to draw business conclusions from data.
